# Card Data Integration Summary

## What was added:

### 1. CardDataLoader (Autoload)
**File**: `Scripts/Core/card_data_loader.gd`
- Loads all JSON files from `Scripts/CardData/` on startup
- Stores card data in a dictionary keyed by card name (e.g., "Swap_10", "Draw_4")
- Provides `get_card_data(card_name)` method to retrieve data

### 2. Card Visual Script (NEW)
**File**: `Scripts/Core/card.gd`
- Attached to `Scenes/Core/card.tscn` (the visual layer)
- Has `set_card_data(data_name)` method that:
  - Loads card data from CardDataLoader
  - Updates Icon texture from `icon_path`
  - Updates ValueLabel/ValueLabel2 with `value`
  - Updates SuitLabel/SuitLabel2 with `suit`
  - Updates Background shader colors with `color_a` and `color_b`

### 3. Interactive Card Enhancement
**File**: `Scripts/Core/interactive_card.gd`
- Added `card_name` variable to store the card's type
- Added `set_card_data(data_name)` method that:
  - Sets the card_name
  - Delegates to the card visual's `set_card_data()` method

### 4. Card Manager Enhancement
**File**: `Scripts/Core/card_manager.gd`
- Added `deck` array to hold card type names
- Added `draw_index` to track deck position
- Added `_initialize_deck()` method that:
  - Creates a deck with all suit/value combinations
  - Shuffles the deck
- Modified `draw_cards()` to call `set_card_data()` on each instantiated card

### 5. Project Configuration
**File**: `project.godot`
- Added CardDataLoader as an autoload singleton

## How it works:

1. On game start, CardDataLoader loads all JSON card data
2. Card Manager initializes a shuffled deck of card names
3. When cards are drawn, Card Manager:
   - Instantiates the interactive_card scene
   - Calls `set_card_data()` on interactive_card with the next card name from the deck
   - interactive_card delegates to card.tscn's script
   - card.tscn configures all visual elements from the JSON data
4. Each card visually displays its icon, value, suit, and colors from the JSON

## Architecture:
- **card.tscn** = Visual layer (holds icon, labels, colors)
- **interactive_card.tscn** = Interaction layer (drag, hover, flip)
- **card_manager.gd** = Instantiation and deck management
- **card_data_loader.gd** = Data provider

## No changes to existing functionality:
- All existing card behavior remains intact
- Draw animations, flip logic, and interactions unchanged
- Only adds data-driven visual configuration
